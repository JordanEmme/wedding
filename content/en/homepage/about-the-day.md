When you arrive at the venue, look out for the direction signs to the Barn. 

Please arrive by 1:30.  
Ceremony at 2pm.

If you wish to eat at the venue before the ceremony, there is a small cafe on-site that will be
serving food from 9am.

If you are staying at the venue, the bell tents are just a few minutes walk away, but if you're
staying in a hotel nearby it's probably better to prebook a taxi. The party will finish at 1am.
Below are a few local firms.

All children and babies are more than welcome and there will be lots of opportunities to play during
the day and a quiet corner if they need a nap!

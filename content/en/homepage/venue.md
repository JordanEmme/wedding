[Old Down Country Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/69hZK3vFVv2xkM1S6)


The venue for the ceremony and reception is all in one place, set inside a
beautiful country park we have enjoyed visiting as a family. The reception will
be held inside but we will also have exclusive use of the large walled garden
and a toddler play area. Depending on the weather, the ceremony may be held
outside and we hope to also enjoy the large outdoor space for aperitif, games
and photos. It will be a very family friendly affair with lots of opportunity
for little ones to play!

The park itself features open woodland, beautiful gardens, adventure play
areas and animal parks, as well as an onsite spa. With so much to do we would
recommend setting some time aside to enjoy it, either the morning of the wedding
or the day after. Should you be so lucky, you will also get to meet Kevin, the
resident peacock.

Free onsite parking is available in the Country Park car park.

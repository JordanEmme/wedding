As many of you know we met through Tim when he was studying in Marseille. Jordan
came to celebrate New Year 2019 in Bideford, after which we became pen pals. It
didn't take long for "pen pals" to turn into a long distance love.

We know how incredibly lucky we are to have found each other and to have
welcomed our two beautiful children into the world. To us, getting married is
the final step in cementing our family. We would love for you to be
there to celebrate our special day with us.

Your presence is more than enough for us, so we are not asking for any gifts. We
appreciate there are already substantial costs for attending, such as travel and
accomodation. However, should you wish to make a donation to our chosen charity,
more information will be shared closer to the day.

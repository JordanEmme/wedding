The venue for the ceremony and reception is located inside a beautiful walled
garden with exclusive use of a large toddler play area. Depending on the
weather, we hope to enjoy the large outdoor space for aperitif, games and
photos.

Should you be so lucky, you will also get to meet Kevin, the resident peacock.
